# Calibra: Automated Photometric Analysis & Calibration Toolkit

**Version:** 3.1 — 2026-05-13
**Description:** 
An automated, highly robust Python toolkit for extracting scientific-grade photometry, calibrating zero points, obtaining color transformation coefficients for V and B filters, and estimating formal CCD/CMOS errors from astronomical monochrome FITS images. Calibra features **Ensemble Differential Photometry** with multiple comparison stars, **Time-Series Light Curve** generation with AAVSO-format reporting, an **Interactive FITS Viewer** with role-based star marking, real-time PSF analysis, and bidirectional synchronization with the photometry pipeline. It integrates **AAVSO VSX** cross-matching to automatically exclude known variable stars from calibration sets.

The code was created with lots of help from Google Antigravity (various agents), guided, tested and debugged by me. I have made several tests to verify the results and ensure the results are reasonable. This code is far from what codes like, e.g., AIJ or Tycho Tracker can do. The purpose is simply to have a playground for understanding the principles of CCD/CMOS based photometry and having a tool to compare to what AIJ or Tycho Tracker provide as fluxes, zero points, etc.

## What's New in v3.1

- **Interactive FITS Viewer — Role-Based Star Marking**: Right-click any star to assign it as **Variable** (red), **Check** (blue), or **Reference** (green). Markers are persistent with aperture/annulus overlays and are listed in dedicated side panels.
- **Real-Time Radial Profile Analysis**: Clicking any star instantly displays a PSF radial profile plot with Gaussian fit overlay, aperture boundary, and annulus boundary — enabling immediate visual verification of photometry settings.
- **In-Viewer Aperture Tuning**: Aperture radius, annulus inner, and annulus outer values are displayed and editable directly inside the viewer. Changes take effect immediately for subsequent markings.
- **Bidirectional Star Synchronization**: Stars defined in the Light Curves tab (target, check, references) are automatically pre-marked when opening the viewer. Conversely, clicking "Export Stars to LC Tab" pushes viewer selections back to the main GUI, automatically triggering catalog magnitude lookups.
- **Bidirectional Aperture Synchronization**: Click "Export Aps to Settings" to push refined aperture/annulus values from the viewer back to the main Settings tab.
- **Darkened FITS Display**: The image rendering now floors the display range to the median, providing high-contrast star visibility against a dark background.

### Previous: v3.0 (2026-05-10)

- Centralized File Management with persistent FITS File Manager.
- Unified Analysis & Calibration workflow tab.
- Plate Solving integration via ASTAP.
- Modern deep-blue professional theme with scrollable interfaces.
- Ensemble Photometry scaling for time-series analysis.

## Quick Start
1.  **Installation**:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib Pillow astropy photutils astroquery
    ```
2.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This launches the **Configuration GUI** where you can set your CCD parameters and file paths. The pipeline supports **Automated Color Calibration**, **Differential Photometry**, and **Time-Series Light Curves** via ATLAS refcat2, APASS DR9, GAIA DR3 and Landolt standard stars.
